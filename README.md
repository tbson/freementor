# Free Mentor

## Mentorship for free

Please don't get me wrong, mentorship doesn't grow on trees! Mentorship is good and good things are hard to be free.

But let's think again. What else can we gain as mentoring someone? There are some benefits:

-   Sharpen our social skills.
-   Improve our knowledge as mentoring / teaching. Trust me, we will be supprised when facing with some basic questions.
-   Have a good relationship with potential compadres for our personal biz.
-   Helping new generation is an adorable job.

We are mentors, not teachers so we have some expectations about mentees, we are not interested in fresher (haven't any
knowledge about any programming language).

We welcome everyone who needs mentorship, let's get contact.
